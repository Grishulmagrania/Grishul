---

## 7. Array Slicing

Learned how to extract portions of arrays.

Practiced:

- Row slicing
- Column slicing
- Selecting submatrices
- Combining row and column slicing

Observed how slicing returns views of arrays.

---

## 8. Boolean Indexing

Introduced conditional filtering using Boolean expressions.

Implemented:

- Selecting elements greater than a given value.
- Selecting elements less than a specified value.
- Filtering arrays using logical conditions.

Learned how Boolean indexing simplifies data filtering.

---

## 9. Using `np.where()`

Studied conditional replacement of values.

Implemented a practical example to replace invalid salary values with corrected values using:

- `np.where(condition, true_value, false_value)`

Discussed its usefulness in data cleaning and preprocessing.

---

## 10. Statistical Operations

Performed statistical analysis using NumPy.

Calculated:

- Column-wise mean
- Row-wise mean

Used:

- `np.mean()`
- `axis = 0`
- `axis = 1`

Understood how axis selection changes computation.

---

## 11. Mathematical Operations on Arrays

Implemented element-wise arithmetic operations.

Example:

- Celsius to Fahrenheit temperature conversion.

Observed that NumPy performs calculations on the entire array without using loops.

---

## 12. Feature and Target Separation

Created a student dataset represented as a two-dimensional NumPy array.

Performed:

- Feature extraction
- Target variable extraction

Separated:

- Independent variables (Features)
